# CURE-MakeITReal

Project developed as part of the Siemens MakeIT Real Hackathon on 26th September, 2017. 
C.U.R.E. is a healthcare solution that consists of an Android app, a web application with integrated video calling and a chatbot for disease diagnosis and regular health advice.

From our hackathon project submission report:
\"We wanted to do something for the people in rural areas and help doctors reach them, so that unwanted deaths and suffering can be prevented. Our healthcare solution basically consists of a web app (with interface for both doctor and patient), and an Android app with chatbot whenever for daily checkup / when bandwidth for video conferencing is not available.

We have digitized the process of contacting the doctor, booking appointments, speaking to doctor via video teleconferencing and prescription of medication. Another major aspect of our project was generating data for data analytics. By using the raw data that our application generates, we can learn many things such as the spread of diseases in various parts of the country, relative efficacy of various drugs / antibiotics used for treatment, and heat maps showing spread of diseases.\"

The first prototype implemented the above with the help of third party APIs like Gruveo for video teleconferencing and Google Maps for - you guessed it - maps!
